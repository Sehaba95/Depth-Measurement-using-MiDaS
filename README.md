# Depth Measurement Using MiDaS models
The goal of this repository is to help you test the MiDaS depth measurement models. All you need to do is to upload this notebook to your Google Drive, open it on Google Colab and run all the cells. It will install all the dependencies with the specific versions. You only have to specify a **video input path** in the cell **"Get the frames of a video and save them in the input folder, to use them by the MiDas model"**. The notebook will create two depth videos (using both the large and the small models).
